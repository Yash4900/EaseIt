## About EaseIt
The project has been developed to ensure the safety and convenience of the gated societies. It is a comprehensive society management system keeping in mind every single stakeholder of the gated community i.e. security guards, residents, management committee, facility managers and vendors.
 
**This project aims to:**

Simplify common residential tasks - View notice board, raise your suggestions or grievances, book clubhouse, book helper 

Improve security standards around gated communities - Visitor approval, child safety

Provide parking management - Automatically record entry and exit time of vehicles (by scanning license plate number), allocate parking space to visitors, detect if a visitorâ€™s car is parked in society premises for longer duration

## Features

**Automatic vehicle logging and parking space allocation**

The app allows for easy logging of vehicles entering and leaving the society by just scanning the vehicle license plate. Also the visitor vehicles will be allocated the most suitable parking space based on how much time they would stay in society.  

**Visitor Approval :standing_man:**

Visitors entering the building will be allowed to enter only after getting an approval by the owner. Residents can also pre-approve visitors. The residents can share the approval code to the visitors which they can show at the security desk and enter the society. Daily visitors like milkman, laundry will also be provided a code which will allow them to enter the society.   

**Complaint forum :page_facing_up:**

Residents can post complaints/comments/suggestions on a public forum which will be visible to every other resident. Other residents would be able to like the post allowing them to support the post. The secretary can also share the progress of the action taken against the complaint.
 
**Notice Board :pushpin:**

Just like a physical one, the secretary of the society can post notices on the app itself for every resident to read thus eliminating the need of a physical board.
 
**Maintenance Payment Portal :credit_card:**

This app also allows the resident to pay their maintenance bill online since we will be introducing a payment gateway. This eliminates the need of physically paying the bills.
 
**Add a Helper :man_cook:**

The app will also allow the residents to contact the daily visitors of the society if they think of hiring them. Residents can also rate and review the helpers.
 
**Child Safety :child:**

The application will inform guards to allow children to go outside premises once the pass approval is made from parents .
 
**Residential Contact Details :houses:**

The app shows the owner of flats along with the contact info for communication purposes.
 
**Create account and User authentication :adult:**

Any resident can create an account by entering his/her room number and other details which will then be authenticated by the administrator/secretary of the society and if legitimate, the user will be able to reap the benefits of the all-in-one resident app.
 
**View Profile/Change password :pencil2:**

Any user can view his profile and manage to set his password.
